This package is decommissioned and no longer provides any ASDF schemas.
The schemas provided by the package were duplicates of the schemas provided
by [asdf-standard](https://github.com/asdf-format/asdf-standard).

This repository will be archived after a final release of this package
(which will contain no schemas).

This package includes plugins that provide ASDF serialization support for astropy
objects.  The plugins are automatically enabled when the package is installed.

The plugins in this package supersede those in the ``astropy.io.misc.asdf`` module;
when this package is installed, the astropy plugins will be ignored.  The
``astropy.io.misc.asdf`` module will be removed in a future version of astropy.

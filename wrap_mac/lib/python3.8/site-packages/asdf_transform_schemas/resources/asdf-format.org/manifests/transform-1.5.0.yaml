  title: Send axes to different subtransforms.
  description: |-
    Transforms a set of separable inputs by splitting the axes apart,
    sending them through the given subtransforms in parallel, and
    finally concatenating the subtransform output axes back together.

    The input axes are assigned to each subtransform in order.  If the
    number of input axes is unequal to the sum of the number of input
    axes of all of the subtransforms, that is considered an error case.

    The output axes from each subtransform are appended together to make
    up the resulting output axes.

    For example, given 5 input axes, and 3 subtransforms with the
    following orders:

    1. transform A: 2 in -> 2 out
    1. transform B: 1 in -> 2 out
    1. transform C: 2 in -> 1 out

    The transform is performed as follows:

    ```
      :    i0    i1       i2       i3    i4
      :    |     |        |        |     |
      :  +---------+ +---------+ +----------+
      :  |    A    | |    B    | |    C     |
      :  +---------+ +---------+ +----------+
      :    |     |     |     |        |
      :    o0    o1    o2    o3       o4
    ```

    If reordering of the input or output axes is required, use in series
    with the `remap_axes` transform.

    analytic inverse of this transform.

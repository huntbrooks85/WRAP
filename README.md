<p id="description"> The <b>Wide-field Retrieval of Astrodata Program (WRAP)</b> is a versatile tool designed to simplify the retrieval of photometric and astrometric data from a wide range of ultraviolet, optical, and near-infrared catalogs. Users input Right Ascension (RA) and Declination (DEC) coordinates, along with a search radius for their object of interest. The program then enables users to interactively select their object by simply clicking on it within catalog images. WRAP efficiently compiles and presents all pertinent photometric and astrometric information obtained from the selected catalogs, making it accessible in a convenient CSV file. This streamlines the data retrieval process, enhancing the user's experience</p>

  <p><b>Single-Query:</b></p>
</div>

1. Input the Right Ascension (R.A.) and Declination (Decl.) of the object being searched for in degrees.
2. Input the search radius in arcseconds around the R.A. and Decl.
4. Select the catalogs to be searched through.
5. Click the "Run" button.
6. Your standard web browser will open with WiseView to assist you in finding your object (If WiseView Button Selected).
7. Click on your object when the image appears (if your object is not there, click the red "Object Not Found" button).

</div>

- **Note 1**: Only tested on MacOS >11 and Windows >8; problems may occur for older versions of MacOS and Windows ***(NOT SUPPORTED ON LINUX)***.
- **Note 2**: Windows does not support the astro-datalab package; therefore, Windows does not have the Noirlab Source Catalog option.
- **Note 3**: The orientation for all of the catalogs is North pointed up and East pointing left.
- **Note 4**: Catalog imaging may have strange croppings; this is a warning that it may happen, do not be alarmed by it this is simplfy cropping at the edge of the detector.

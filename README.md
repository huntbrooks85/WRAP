<p id="description"> The <b>Wide-field Retrieval of Astrodata Program (WRAP)</b> is a versatile tool designed to simplify the retrieval of photometric and astrometric data from a wide range of ultraviolet, optical, and near-infrared catalogs. Users input Right Ascension (RA) and Declination (DEC) coordinates, along with a search radius for their object of interest. The program then enables users to interactively select their object by simply clicking on it within catalog images. WRAP efficiently compiles and presents all pertinent photometric and astrometric information obtained from the selected catalogs, making it accessible in a convenient CSV file. This streamlines the data retrieval process, enhancing the user's experience</p>

1. **Download Python Version 3.8:** To use WRAP on MacOS with the WRAP.command file, python version 3.8 needs to be installed. Visit [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-380/) to install Python version 3.8.0. 
2. **Verify Installation:** Enter your terminal and type ```python3.8``` to see if the terminal returns ```>>>``` as an output. If you see this then you may continue, if it does not return this then Python has not correctly installed. 
3. **Running WRAP.command:** Double click ```WRAP.command``` and wait a few minutes as required packages are installed.

**Note**: Making use of an Anaconda (Conda) environment is highly recommended due to potential compatibility issues with older Python and pip packages when using WRAP.

1. **Download Anaconda Navigator**: To get started, please visit [Anaconda's official website](https://www.anaconda.com) and download the version of Anaconda Navigator that matches your operating system.

2. **Access Anaconda Environments**: After downloading and installing Anaconda Navigator, launch the application. In the Navigator's main window, you will find an "Environments" option on the left. Click on it to access your Conda environments.

3. **Create a New Conda Environment**: In the "Environments" section, you will see a plus sign labeled "Create." Click on it to create a new Conda environment.

4. **Customize Environment Settings**: Give your new environment a name of your choice (e.g., "WRAP"). Next, select a Python version that is closest to Python 3.8 (e.g., 3.8.18). Then, click the "Create" button to create the environment.

5. **Environment Creation**: The environment creation process may take a while, as Conda will install the necessary packages and dependencies for WRAP.

6. **Activate Your Conda Environment**: Once the environment is successfully created, you can activate it in your terminal. Open your terminal and enter the following command, replacing `*conda name*` with the name you chose for your environment:
   ```bash
   conda activate *conda name*

1. Once the conda environment is activated, go to your directory containing the WRAP contents (e.g., "cd Documents/GitHub/WRAP").
2. Enter the "pip_module" directory (e.g., "cd pip_module")
3. Run the command:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements-mac.txt

**Single Object Search**

1. Input the Right Ascension (RA) and Declination (DEC) of the object being searched for in degrees.
2. Input the search radius in arcseconds around the RA and DEC.
3. Specify the desired output file name (without a file type). WRAP will save results to a CSV file by default.
4. Select the catalogs to be searched through.
5. Click the green "Run Wrap" button.
6. Your standard web browser will open with WISEView to assist you in finding your object.
7. Click on your object when the image appears (if your object is not there, click the red "Object Not Found" button).
8. Repeat these steps until every catalog image is shown.
9. All data is saved to a CSV file with your specified output name in the "Output" folder. If no output name was provided, it will default to "WRAP_output.csv."

**Multi-Object Search**

1. Click the "Browse" button and select your file with a list of RA ("ra") and DEC ("dec") coordinates in degrees.
2. Input the search radius in arcseconds around the RA and DEC.
3. Choose the file type used.
4. Specify the output file name (without a file type).
5. Select the catalogs to be searched through.
6. Click the green "Run Wrap" button.
7. Your standard web browser will open with WISEView to assist you in finding your object (it will do this for every new object).
8. Click on your object when the image appears (if your object is not there, click the red "Object Not Found" button).
9. Repeat these steps until every catalog image is shown, and every object has been processed.
10. All data is saved to a CSV file with your specified output name in the "Output" folder. If no output name was provided, it will default to "WRAP_output.csv."

- **Note 1**: Only tested on MacOS >11 and Windows >8; problems may occur for older versions of MacOS and Windows ***(NOT SUPPORTED ON LINUX)***.
- **Note 2**: Windows does not support the astro-datalab package; therefore, Windows does not have the Noirlab Source Catalog option.
- **Note 3**: The window close button has been disabled; to close WRAP, please click the red "Close WRAP" button at the bottom.
- **Note 4**: The orientation for all of the catalogs is North pointed up and East pointing left.
- **Note 5**: Catalog imaging may have strange croppings; this is a warning that it may happen, do not be alarmed by it this is simplfy cropping by the edge of the detector.

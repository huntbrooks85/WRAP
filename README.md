<p id="description"> The <b>Wide-field Retrieval of Astrodata Program (WRAP)</b> is a versatile tool designed to simplify the retrieval of photometric and astrometric data from a wide range of ultraviolet, optical, and near-infrared catalogs. Users input Right Ascension (RA) and Declination (DEC) coordinates, along with a search radius for their object of interest. The program then enables users to interactively select their object by simply clicking on it within catalog images. WRAP efficiently compiles and presents all pertinent photometric and astrometric information obtained from the selected catalogs, making it accessible in a convenient CSV file. This streamlines the data retrieval process, enhancing the user's experience</p>

  <p><b>How to Use WRAP</b></p>
</div>
<div align="center">
</div>

<div align="left">
  <p><b>Single-Query:</b></p>
</div>

1. Enter the **Right Ascension (R.A.)** and **Declination (Decl.)** of the object in **decimal degrees**.
2. Specify the **search radius** in arcseconds around the R.A./Decl.
3. Select the **catalogs** you wish to query.
4. Click the **"Run"** button.
5. If the **WiseView** option is selected, your default browser will open WiseView to assist in identifying the object.
6. When the image appears, **click on your object**.  
   If it‚Äôs not visible, click the **red "Object Not Found"** button.
7. Repeat this process until all catalog images are reviewed.
8. Your query results will appear in the **"Table List"** panel on the left.
9. Click **"Save"** to export the results as a CSV file.

<div align="left">
  <p><b>Multi-Query:</b></p>
</div>

1. Check the **"Multi-Query"** checkbox.
2. Upload a **CSV file**:
   - R.A. column must be named `input_ra`
   - Decl. column must be named `input_dec`
3. Enter the **search radius** in arcseconds.
4. Select the **catalogs** to search.
5. Click the **"Run"** button.
6. If the **WiseView** option is selected, your default browser will open it.
7. When the image appears, **click on your object**, or use the **"Object Not Found"** button if it's missing.
8. Repeat the process for each catalog image.
9. Query results will be listed in the **"Table List"** panel. Click **"Save"** to export them as a CSV file.

</div>

- **Note 1**: Only tested on MacOS >11 and Windows >8; problems may occur for older versions of MacOS and Windows ***(NOT SUPPORTED ON LINUX)***.
- **Note 2**: Windows does not support the astro-datalab package; therefore, Windows does not have the Noirlab Source Catalog option.
- **Note 3**: The orientation for all of the catalogs is North pointed up and East pointing left.
- **Note 4**: Catalog imaging may have strange croppings; this is a warning that it may happen, do not be alarmed by it this is simplfy cropping at the edge of the detector.

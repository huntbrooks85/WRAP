Purpose: 
To gather photometry and astrometry using images to trace high proper motion objects. 

How to use: 
1) Select if you are find photometry and astrometry for a single object or multiple objects.

	For Single Object Search
2) Input the RA and DEC (in degrees) of the object being searched for
3) Input the radius (in arcsecs) around the RA and DEC that is being searched for
4) Put in the output file name that you want, do not put a file type at the end
5) Select the catalogs that will be searched through
6) Click the green "Run Wrap" button
7) Click on the your object when the image appears (if your object is not there click the "Object Not Found" button)
8) Repeat until every catalog image is shown

	For Multi-Object Search
2) Click the "Browse" button and click on you file with a list of RA and DEC's (in degrees)
3) Input the radius (in arcsecs) around the RA and DEC that is being searched for
4) Click the "Filetype" browser and select the file type being used
5) Put in the output file name that you want, do not put a file type at the end
6) Select the catalogs that will be searched through
7) Click the green "Run Wrap" button
8) Click on the your object when the image appears (if your object is not there click the "Object Not Found" button)
